- Installation 1

Before running the scripts, you need to install the required third-party libraries. This project uses a `requirements.txt` file to manage its dependencies.

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt



- Running the Script

This project consists of a single Python script called `main.py`. Follow these instructions to run the script.

- Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). This script has been tested with Python 3.8 and above.

- Installation 2

No additional libraries are required to run this script, as it only uses the Python Standard Library.

- Running the script

To run `main.py`, open a terminal in the directory where `main.py` is located and execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
